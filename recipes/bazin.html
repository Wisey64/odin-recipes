    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bazin is a traditional Libyan dish made from barley flour, water, and salt. 
       The dough is cooked to a thick consistency and formed into a round shape. 
       It is often served with a rich tomato-based sauce, potatoes, boiled eggs, and lamb or goat meat. 
       This dish is typically enjoyed as a communal meal, where family and friends gather around to eat together.</p>

        <li>In a separate pot, heat olive oil and brown the meat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste, turmeric, cumin, salt, and pepper. Add water or broth and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes to the pot and cook until they are tender and the meat is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Place the cooked meat and potatoes around the Bazin on the serving platter. Pour the sauce over the dish and garnish with the hard-boiled eggs.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy with family and friends.</li>
